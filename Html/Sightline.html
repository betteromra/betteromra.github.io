<h3>First game jam experience</h3>
<p>
  This project marked my first-ever participation in a Game Jam.
  Our team initially consisted of four members, but one member became inactive once the event began,
  leaving us as a team of three developers. Despite the limited team size and the absence of an artist,
  we successfully completed a playable and engaging prototype within the strict time constraints of the competition.

  The development process was both challenging and rewarding.
  We focused on creating a competitive experience that included a functional
  leaderboard system linked to an online server.
  This required me to learn about network communication, API integration and
  HTTP requests to manage player scores and synchronize data between clients and the remote database.

  There was a mechanic to slow down time, but it was also unintentionally slowing down the speedrun timer.
  We wanted the time-slowing ability to give the player an advantage while still introducing a drawback,
  since they would move slower too, but not to affect the speedrun timer. To fix this, I switched to using
  real time instead of the in-game time since the start and it worked much better.

  Time management was a crucial skill I developed during this project.
  Working under the intense time pressure of a game jam environment taught me how to prioritize features,
  identify minimum viable functionality and use asset packages and
  plug-ins strategically to accelerate production without sacrificing quality.
  This experience helped me understand the importance of efficient workflow pipelines and rapid iteration in game
  development.

  Overall, this game jam reinforced key lessons in collaboration, adaptability and agile development practices.
  As well as the ability to transform creative ideas into a functional prototype within a highly compressed timeframe.
