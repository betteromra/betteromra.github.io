<h3>Data-driven design and dynamic difficulty</h3>
<p>
  This was my first personal project and it focused heavily on creating a
  data-driven architecture using scriptable objects in Unity.
  The main goal of the project was to design a flexible system that could dynamically generate
  levels by selecting recipes from a data bank while maintaining a balanced
  and engaging level of difficulty.
</p>

  I implemented an algorithm to select recipes procedurally based on predefined difficulty curves.
  The system ensured that each level generated contained challenges that were neither too simple nor overly complex.
  To achieve this, I introduced a graduated difficulty mechanic, increasing the complexity of
  recipes while compensating with speed bonuses to preserve pacing and prevent player fatigue.
</p>

  Once a recipe was chosen, the system automatically retrieved all the required ingredients and ensured that
  at least one of each was available in the generated level. After populating the mandatory elements,
  I developed a secondary logic layer to fill the remaining slots with randomized ingredients
  to keep gameplay fresh and unpredictable while preserving the overall balance of the experience.

  Through this project, I deepened my understanding of procedural generation,
  data encapsulation and system scalability, all essential skills for building robust and adaptable game mechanics.
