<h3>Physics-based movement and rewind system</h3>
<p>
  This project was heavily inspired by
  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/460950/Katana_ZERO/" target="_blank">Katana ZERO</a>
  and focused on creating fast-paced,
  physics-driven gameplay. The most technically challenging part of development involved implementing
  smooth character and enemy movement across sloped surfaces while maintaining a
  consistent velocity regardless of terrain inclination.
</p>
<p>
  To achieve this, I had to refine the movement physics by adjusting
  Rigidbody2D forces and custom velocity calculations, ensuring both the player and enemies
  preserved uniform motion across varying slope gradients. This required careful handling of
  raycasts and normal vectors to maintain grounded movement and prevent speed fluctuations.
</p>
<p>
  One of the core mechanics I implemented was a rewind system,
  which involved capturing and storing the player's positional data over time.
  The system continuously recorded the player's transform.position at each frame,
  and when triggered, it iterated backward through the stored data to restore the player's
  previous states with precise temporal accuracy. This mechanic introduced challenges in
  data management and interpolation, especially when handling physics-based interactions.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, I designed a grappling hook mechanic using Unity's
  SpringJoint2D component combined with a LineRenderer for visual feedback.
  The grappling system allowed the player to attach to walls dynamically, generating tension and
  swing physics that enhanced both traversal and combat fluidity.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, this project deepened my understanding of 2D physics simulation,
  data-driven rewind mechanics and procedural animation techniques,
  all of which contributed to a more polished and technically complex gameplay experience.
