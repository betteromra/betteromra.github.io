<h3>Advanced boss design and behavior trees</h3>
<p>
  In this project, I focused on creating dynamic, content-driven boss encounters using a custom
  blueprint system. My goal was to implement complex AI behaviors and phase-based
  mechanics to challenge players while maintaining engaging and interactive combat.
  The game was developed as a multiplayer experience, allowing multiple players to cooperate during intense boss fights
  and dynamically adapt to evolving challenges together.

  The first boss was a lava rock monster with three distinct attacks:
  meteor strikes from the sky, fire projectiles and summoned minions.
  Its behavior was governed by a behavior tree system and its attack strength dynamically
  scaled according to its health-based phases. Additionally, this boss had terrain-destructive abilities.
  As the fight progressed, the environment became increasingly damaged, creating new hazards such as
  underground lava that required the players to continuously adapt their strategy and coordinate positioning to survive.

  The second boss, a Treant, specialized in environmental control.
  It spawned vines to defend itself, could summon a row of damaging vines toward the players,
  and create a circular zone of vine attacks beneath player positions.
  Furthermore, it could generate smaller treants from uncut trees, introducing layered threats and forcing the team to
  manage multiple priorities simultaneously, balancing crowd control, area awareness and target focus.

  The third boss, a spider entity, focused on mobility and area denial.
  It spawned smaller spiders, shot cobwebs to restrict player movement and constantly maintained distance from players
  to enforce strategic positioning.
  If players got too close, it began using powerful bite attacks. Because ranged combat was the most effective strategy,
  the spider AI was designed to intelligently kite players, keeping them at bay while maintaining offensive pressure.
  Designing this boss required careful calibration of AI decision-making to ensure it intelligently prioritized
  positioning, spawning and attack timing even in multiplayer scenarios.

  Overall, this project enhanced my understanding of behavior tree architecture,
  phase-based AI scaling, procedural environmental interaction and how to design layered, reactive encounters.
  It also emphasized the importance of balancing challenge, telegraphing mechanics and creating emergent gameplay
  scenarios within cooperative multiplayer boss fights, where teamwork and strategy were critical to success.

  In this project, I also implemented a pirate boat environment populated by goblin NPCs with complex, task-driven
  behaviors.
  Each goblin had a set of responsibilities that contributed to a living and interactive world.
</p>
<p>
  Their tasks included loading cannonballs into cannons, firing at beach guards
  and performing daily routines such as eating and sleeping. These behaviors were managed by a
  task scheduling system, which allowed the AI to prioritize actions, respond to environmental triggers
  and switch between combat, maintenance and rest activities dynamically.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, this project enhanced my understanding of dynamic AI systems, task prioritization
  and environment-driven behaviors, enabling me to create more immersive and interactive gameplay scenarios.
