<h3>Deepening my programming knowledge</h3>
<p>
  This project significantly expanded my understanding of programming principles beyond the surface level.
  I began to integrate more advanced paradigms of Object-Oriented Programming,
  applying concepts such as Polymorphism, Encapsulation,
  Data Abstraction and Inheritance to create cleaner and more modular code structures.

  Through hands-on experimentation, I learned how to utilize coroutines correctly for asynchronous operations,
  managing time-dependent behaviors such as cooldowns, animations and event-driven logic. I also implemented custom
  event systems to decouple
  gameplay logic, improving scalability and maintainability across different game components.

  My primary focus throughout this project was not on crafting a polished gameplay experience,
  but rather on optimizing performance, ensuring system stability and designing an architecture that could
  scale efficiently for future features. This approach helped me internalize core software engineering concepts
  like code reusability, modularity and efficient memory management within a game engine context.
