<h3>Turn-based mechanics and AI fundamentals</h3>
<p>
  This was a relatively small-scale project, but it introduced several key challenges that deepened my understanding of
  game logic and artificial intelligence systems. The most technically demanding aspect was implementing the
  turn-based gameplay architecture, which required precise state management, player input handling and
  synchronization between player and AI turns.

  Developing simple AI behaviors presented an engaging challenge.
  I designed multiple enemy archetypes with distinct logic patterns. One enemy utilized a line-of-sight detection system
  that triggered the enemy to walk to the player position and capture him if it was his turn.
  Another followed a predefined patrol route using waypoint navigation;
  and a third exhibited randomized movement.
