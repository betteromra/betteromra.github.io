<h3>Peer-to-Peer Multiplayer Networking</h3>
<p>
  This project represented my first experience developing a multiplayer game,
  where I was primarily responsible for implementing and optimizing the networked gameplay systems.
  I built a peer-to-peer connection model that allowed players on the same local
  network to seamlessly connect and interact in real time.
</p>
<p>
  Developing this functionality required an in-depth understanding of network architecture,
  including distinctions between client-side and server-side operations.
  Early in development, I encountered synchronization and authority issues that occurred because
  certain actions were not properly replicated on the client side. Through iterative testing, I learned
  how to manage data flow securely between hosts and clients, handle latency compensation,
  and address potential security vulnerabilities inherent to P2P systems.

<p>
  The project also reinforced the importance of team collaboration.
  Because team availability varied significantly, we relied heavily on well-documented code,
  inline comments and consistent naming conventions to maintain
  project clarity and ensure that each developer could contribute effectively despite asynchronous work schedules.
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately, this experience strengthened my understanding of multiplayer system design,
  network synchronization and the critical role of clean, maintainable code
  in distributed development environments.
