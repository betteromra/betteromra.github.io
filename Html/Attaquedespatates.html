<h3>Collaborative game development experience</h3>
<p>
  This project represented a significant leap in complexity and ambition compared to my earlier individual endeavors.
  Our development team consisted of two artists and two programmers, each contributing to different aspects of the
  production pipeline.
  The project's core functionality had already been implemented, so our task as programmers was to extend the feature
  set,
  refactor unstable code segments and resolve numerous technical issues inherited from prior iterations.
</p>
<p>
  Among the major additions we implemented were unique monster abilities,
  enhanced interactive storytelling elements and a final boss encounter
  featuring advanced state management and AI-driven attack patterns. These additions required close collaboration
  between
  the programming and art teams to synchronize gameplay logic with animation states, visual effects and sound cues.
</p>
<p>
  This project became a pivotal experience in understanding the dynamics of team-based software development.
  I learned how to efficiently distribute tasks using agile-inspired workflows, manage version control using Git and
  GitHub branches to minimize merge conflicts and conduct regular code reviews to ensure architectural consistency.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, I gained valuable experience in reading and interpreting existing codebases, learning to understand
  another developer's logic, design patterns and architectural choices. This process improved my debugging skills,
  deepened my understanding of collaborative programming practices and reinforced the importance of clean,
  well-documented and modular code when working in a shared environment.
