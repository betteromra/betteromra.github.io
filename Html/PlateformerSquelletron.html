<h3>Procedural generation and 2D lighting</h3>
<p>
  This project centered around creating a procedurally generated maze that the main character could navigate.
  The development process was guided by our instructor, but by the final phase, we were encouraged to integrate our own
  unique gameplay mechanics and technical features.

  Through this project, I explored the core principles that make a platformer both engaging and dynamic,
  responsive controls, clear feedback loops and level design that encourages exploration and flow.
  I gained practical experience in implementing procedural content generation algorithms to create
  infinitely expanding levels, learning firsthand about the structural challenges of generating
  coherent environments that maintain both playability and performance stability.

  The project was developed collaboratively between two team members. While sharing tasks proved difficult, largely due
  to
  my enthusiasm and desire to handle multiple aspects of the development process, it reinforced the importance of
  workload distribution, communication and collaborative version control
  in team-based environments.

  Additionally, I experimented with Unity's 2D lighting system, implementing real-time lighting
  to enhance visual depth and atmosphere. This led me to confront performance optimization challenges,
  particularly when managing a high number of active light sources and taught me how to balance graphical fidelity with
  runtime efficiency.
