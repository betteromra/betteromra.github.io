<h3>Ambition and scope management</h3>
<p>
  At that stage of my journey, I was extremely ambitious and invested a significant amount of time experimenting with UI
  mechanics.
  I spent nearly three full days developing a carousel-style animated main menu interface, implementing rotation logic
  and smooth transitions
  using Lerp() functions for seamless element movement. I was starting to create my own script and understanding how C#
  worked.

  Once the user interface was functional, I shifted focus to the main player character. My goal was to replicate the
  fluid and responsive combat
  mechanics of <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-sg/champions/riven/" target="_blank">Riven</a>
  from League of Legends. This led me to design and prototype the Q ability, this was a very hard task at that time, I
  managed
  to make it work after barely understanding coroutine and the UI System that show the radial cooldown on the ability.

  My narrow focus on this subsystem caused me to neglect other critical components, the visual assets, basic core
  gameplay and overall content.
  As a result, the project became visually unpolished and uninteresting.
</p>
<p>
  Through this experience, I learned an invaluable lesson about project scope management and resource allocation
  in solo development. I realized the importance of adopting an incremental development approach, creating smaller,
  achievable milestones
  and maintaining a balance between ambition and feasibility when working independently on large-scale projects.
