<h3>Unreal Engine Weapon Systems and Character Upgrades</h3>
<p>
  This project was a large-scale Unreal Engine game where I was responsible for designing and implementing the weapon
  systems.
  My work included multiple core features such as reload mechanics, weapon overheating,
  critical hits, damage falloff over distance and on-hit visual and particle effects.
</p>
<p>
  This was my first experience working with Unreal Engine and I quickly became proficient with Blueprints,
  BlueprintCallable functions, C++ integration, Data Assets and
  Data Tables. I also learned to utilize Unreal's sweep-based bullet physics to implement realistic projectile
  interactions.
</p>
<p>
  I created a variety of weapons including a pistol, shotgun, assault rifle,
  submachine gun, sniper rifle and rocket launcher. Each weapon featured unique behavior and was integrated into the
  overall combat system.
  There was also a system to switch between bullet type, so it was possible to switch from incendary ammo to normal
  ammor to poison ammo,
  all working with applying effect on hit that stacked to certain ammount.
</p>

  In addition to weapon systems, I implemented a character upgrade system.
  Players could enhance their main character by adding health, armor and carry weight capacity.
  Weapon upgrades included reduced spread for shotguns, increased magazine capacity,
  higher bullet velocity and faster firing rates. These upgrades required careful balancing to ensure
  a meaningful progression system while maintaining gameplay challenge.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, this project gave me extensive experience with Unreal Engine's Blueprint system,
  C++ integration, gameplay mechanics design and creating modular, scalable systems for both weapons and player
  progression.
