<h3>Early game development journey</h3>
<p>
  During that period, I was deeply fascinated by the idea of developing game on a computer.
  Initially, I experimented with creating simple games on my graphing calculator, utilizing basic scripting logic and
  procedural programming concepts. However, I was unable to transition those small-scale projects into more complex
  software builds.

  My first real exposure to professional game development came through
  <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=beuoNuK2tbk" target="_blank">Brackeys' Unity tutorial : How to make a Tower
    Defense Game</a>.
  At the beginning, I had minimal understanding of how the Unity Engine worked, concepts such as
  GameObjects, Components, Transform and Vectors were completely new to me.
  I meticulously followed the tutorial line by line, replicating each C# script and inspecting how the
  game loop functioned under the hood.
</p>
<p>
  Through this process, I gained a much better understanding of fundamental principles such as
  object-oriented programming, FixedUpdate()/Update() and Awake()/Start() methods in the Unity scripting lifecycle
  and how to attach custom scripts to GameObjects via the component-based architecture.
  I also learned to manipulate movement to make the ennemy follow a path, implement collision detection,
  and utilize the Inspector for parameter tuning and debugging.

  This hands-on experience served as a crucial foundation for my future in software engineering and game development.
  It enhanced my computational thinking, introduced me to the concept of a real-time rendering pipeline and
  helped me bridge the gap between simple linear programming and practical implementation within an IDE within a much
  more complexe program.
